# Claude Entry Instructions

Use `AGENTS.md` in this repository as the primary project guidance for implementation details, architecture constraints, testing style, and workflow expectations.

If instructions conflict:

1. Prefer direct user instructions.
2. Then prefer repository-specific rules in `AGENTS.md`.
3. Then apply generic assistant defaults.

Start each coding task by reading `AGENTS.md`.
